Q1. For Loop vs While Loop
For Loop: A for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).

While Loop: A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and the loop continues until a certain condition is met.

Example:
For Loop: Use this when you want to iterate over a fixed range or a collection of items.

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

While Loop: Use this when the number of iterations depends on a condition.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

sum_for = 0
product_for = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_for += i

print("Using For Loop:")
print("Sum:", sum_for)
print("Product:", product_for)

Q3. Python Program to Compute the Electricity Bill for a Household

def calculate_electricity_bill(units):
    if units <= 100:
        bill = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20
    return bill
units_consumed = float(input("Enter the units of electricity consumed: "))
bill = calculate_electricity_bill(units_consumed)
print(f"The total electricity bill is: Rs. {bill}")

Q4. Python Program to Calculate Cube of Numbers and Filter by Divisibility

numbers = list(range(1, 101))
divisible_by_4_or_5 = []

for num in numbers:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        divisible_by_4_or_5.append(num)

print("Numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5:", divisible_by_4_or_5)
